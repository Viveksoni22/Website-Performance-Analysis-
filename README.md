# Website Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing key website performance metrics such as sessions, users, traffic channels, and engagement behavior over time. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that improve user experience, content strategy, and marketing effectiveness.

## About

This analysis investigates traffic patterns, user behavior, and engagement across different marketing channels using real-time website analytics data. It aims to answer critical business questions such as:

1. What patterns or trends are observed in website sessions and users over time?
2. Which marketing channel brought the highest number of users to the website, and how can this insight help increase traffic from other channels?
3. Which channel has the highest average engagement time, and what does that indicate about user interest and content relevance?
4. How does engagement rate vary across different traffic channels?
5. Which channels are driving more engaged sessions compared to non-engaged ones, and what strategies can improve underperforming channels?
6. What time of day does each channel drive the most traffic?
7. Is there any correlation between high traffic (sessions) and high engagement rate over time?
